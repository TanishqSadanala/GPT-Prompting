The opportunity allowed students to practice their knowledge and ga uge their \\nunderstanding of cybers ecurity threats and the required mitigation measures. Overall, \\ncybersecurity games are designed in ways that stimulate student s’ interest to learn  about \\ncybersecurity and motivate them to become cybersecurity professionals.  \\nCONCLUSION  \\nThe analysis of the studies in this systematic review reveals a significant shortage of \\ncybersecurity professionals. The scarcity of cybersecurity professionals negatively affect s the \\npopulation and quality of mentors available to students seeking to becom e cybersecurity \\nprofessionals and impact s the quality of training such students receive. Lack of mentorship, poor \\ntraining , and lacking  the necessary cybersecurity skills needed to secure employment in the \\ninformation security sector has discouraged many s tudents from selecting cybersecurity as a \\ncareer. This paper aimed to identify strategies to address the cybersecurity challenges in \\neducation , such as the scarcity of cybersecurity professionals to teach and train students , while \\nincreasing the number of those willing to become cybersecurity professionals. From the \\nsystematic review of literature, it was evident that game -based strategies are effective in \\nincreasing student s’ cybersecurity awareness and their decision to become cybersecurity \\nprofessionals.  To solve the scarcity of cybersecurity professionals, the researcher established that \\nincreasing the number of students willing to choose cybersecurity as a career and providing them \\nthe necessary support until graduation proved effective.  \\nSUGGESTION  \\nThe games reported in the peer -reviewed studies focused on increasing student s’ \\ncybersecurity awareness and did not necessarily examine their skills in cybersecurity. For future \\nresearch, game designers and developers may want to develop advance d games that ga uge the \\nstudent s’ cybersecurity skills and ability to respond to aggressive cyberattacks in addition to \\nenhancing their knowledge of cybersecurity.  \\nACKNOWLEDGMENT  \\nThe author received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of \\nthis article .    \\nREFERENCES  \\nAhn, E.

The opportunity allowed students to practice their knowledge and ga uge their \\nunderstanding of cybers ecurity threats and the required mitigation measures. Overall, \\ncybersecurity games are designed in ways that stimulate student s’ interest to learn  about \\ncybersecurity and motivate them to become cybersecurity professionals.  \\nCONCLUSION  \\nThe analysis of the studies in this systematic review reveals a significant shortage of \\ncybersecurity professionals. The scarcity of cybersecurity professionals negatively affect s the \\npopulation and quality of mentors available to students seeking to becom e cybersecurity \\nprofessionals and impact s the quality of training such students receive. Lack of mentorship, poor \\ntraining , and lacking  the necessary cybersecurity skills needed to secure employment in the \\ninformation security sector has discouraged many s tudents from selecting cybersecurity as a \\ncareer. This paper aimed to identify strategies to address the cybersecurity challenges in \\neducation , such as the scarcity of cybersecurity professionals to teach and train students , while \\nincreasing the number of those willing to become cybersecurity professionals. From the \\nsystematic review of literature, it was evident that game -based strategies are effective in \\nincreasing student s’ cybersecurity awareness and their decision to become cybersecurity \\nprofessionals.  To solve the scarcity of cybersecurity professionals, the researcher established that \\nincreasing the number of students willing to choose cybersecurity as a career and providing them \\nthe necessary support until graduation proved effective.  \\nSUGGESTION  \\nThe games reported in the peer -reviewed studies focused on increasing student s’ \\ncybersecurity awareness and did not necessarily examine their skills in cybersecurity. For future \\nresearch, game designers and developers may want to develop advance d games that ga uge the \\nstudent s’ cybersecurity skills and ability to respond to aggressive cyberattacks in addition to \\nenhancing their knowledge of cybersecurity.  \\nACKNOWLEDGMENT  \\nThe author received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of \\nthis article .    \\nREFERENCES  \\nAhn, E.
